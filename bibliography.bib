    abstract =  {Cyclic redundancy check (CRC) codes {[}Peterson{]} are shortened cyclic codes used for error detection. A number of CRC codes have been adopted in standards: ATM, IEC, IEEE, CCITT, IBM-SDLC, and more {[}Baicheva{]}. The most important expectation from this kind of code is a very low probability for undetected errors. The probability of undetected errors in such codes has been, and still is, subject to extensive studies that have included both analytical models and simulations. Those codes have been used extensively in communications and magnetic recording as they demonstrate good 'burst error' detection capabilities, but are also good at detecting several independent bit errors. Hardware implementations are very simple and well known; their simplicity has made them popular with hardware developers for many years. However, algorithms and software for effective implementations of CRC are now also widely available {[}Williams{]}. The probability of undetected errors depends on the polynomial selected to generate the code, the error distribution (error model), and the data length. In this memo, we attempt to give some estimates for the probability of undetected errors to facilitate the selection of an error detection code for iSCSI. We will also attempt to compare CRCs with other checksum forms (Fletcher, Adler, weighted checksums), as permitted by available data.},

     abstract={Precision medicine describes the definition of disease at a higher resolution by genomic and other technologies to enable more precise targeting of subgroups of disease with new therapies. Prominent examples include cystic fibrosis and cancer.Clinical genomics exists at the intersection of sequencing-led discovery genetics in population cohorts and historical low-throughput approaches to genetic diagnosis in patients. As a result of the different aims of these two endeavours, technologies and algorithms that have been developed for discovery genomics need to be optimized before application to clinical medicine.Areas of need include the improvement of sequencing technologies. Current short-read approaches are limited in areas of the genome of low complexity (such as repeats), regions of high GC content, regions that are highly polymorphic or that include small-scale (indel) or large-scale (structural variant) disruption of the open reading frame.Possible routes to such improvements include long-read sequencing, improved algorithms for indel and structural variant calling, graph reference approaches and standardization of nomenclature.One area that requires specific attention is the quality and coverage of sequence data for clinical genetic testing. In general, the emerging consensus standard is that the coding regions of interest (plus two base pairs on either side) should be covered by 20 high-quality (Q20) reads that are uniquely mapped.To improve assertions of the disease causality of genetic variants, data sharing of both phenotypic and genotypic information across communities will be required. Projects such as ClinGen and its associated database ClinVar represent an important step in this direction. Large-scale population sequencing projects such as the UK Biobank and the US Precision Medicine Initiative Cohort Program will enhance our understanding of population-scale genetic variation in a way that optimizes our care of the individual with genetic disease.},
